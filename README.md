Phuzzy: Fuzzing Phishing Redirects via User-Agent Mapping
[toc]
## Abstract
> The goal of this project is to fuzz suspected phishing links for malware enumeration. As malicious actors get more creative at targeted malware delivery to increase efficiency and reduce exposure what can we do to better identify these malicious exploits? This project will fuzz and log the results for further analysis.

## Obfscation Techniques
> Through our own analysis we've discovered that malicious actors have become more sophisticated in targeting specific environments like mobile devices. They also employ layered redirects using various techniques to make it less likely to be detected by cybersecurity tools, in some instances even returning 404 errors.
